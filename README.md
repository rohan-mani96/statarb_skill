I used a Kaggle dataset with stock prices of BTCBUSD and BTCUSDT to make decisions to buy/sell BTC based on predicted stock returns an hour or two in the future. A wider bid/ask spread would indicate you'd buy the higher priced asset and a narrower spread would indicate an increase in the price of the lower priced asset so you would buy that before the price increase hoping for a quick bang for your buck.
